## User Experience

Watch Calorie Counter is designed to make calorie counting as simple as possible by enabling user's to keep track of their daily calorie intake goal with just a couple of taps on their wrist.
The "home screen" of the app displays in large text their total remaining calories needing to be consumed, along with a button to log calories they've consumed.
By scrolling down slightly, the user will also see a "reset" button which will reset their remaining calories back to their intake goal.

After hitting "submit", the user will then be taken to a screen where they can enter the number of calories they would like to log either via a number pad, speech-to-text, or by writing out the number with their finger.

Thanks to WatchConnectivity, the iPhone app on the user's phone will keep track of the consumed calories entered from the user's Apple Watch and update the remaining calories accordingly. 
The iPhone interface is also where the user can set their daily goal. They may also log calories and reset their remaining calories from the phone.
